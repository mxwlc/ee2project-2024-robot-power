# Electronics Design Project Briefing

**Back : [[Year 2/ELEC50015/Meetings Notes/Landing|Landing]]**

## TODO

1. setup git hub
2. read into the parts I am interested in
   
   ## Aims
- Improve System Engineering skills
  - Abstract problems into easier to solve sub problems
  - Hierarchical Design
- Synthesise objectives into a specification of what needs to happen
- Elements of hardware and software design
- Project Management/Organisation skills
- Presentations -> reports/oral
- Improve coding skills

## Organisation

### Lab Times

Labs are open 0900-1700hrs every weekday. -> good idea to schedule

### Purchasing

- Components ordered through app
- Â£60 Budget
- Use mainly for errors/broken pieces of kit
  - NB: Trial and error on electronics could lead to breaking the components due to poor wiring.
- 3D printing and laser cutting facilities in the Lab

### Managing

- Allocate Tasks
  - CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR IMPORTANT
  - Keep on top
- Agile Plan -> General structure complete then refine
  - refine -> iterative

### Interim Presentation

- 3-06-24 - 15 min
- System design questions
  - diagrams / posters / presentation
- Project Management questions
- Interface Problems

### Report

10k Words -> images and figures

#### Technical Chapters

Chapters containing background information of the sub modules, talk about

- Requirements
- Design
- Pros/cons
- Testing
  
  #### Systems Chapters

Chapters on how everything connects together

- Top level designs and testing

### Demo

- Show the system is working together
- Convice marker the design is achieved
- Each group member is asked about their parts
  
  ### Assessment
  
  Individually marked, submitted as a group
- Mark schemes will be added to git hub

## Choices

### Balance robot

- 2 wheels
- Can complete a task -> to decide upon at a later date
- Sensors
- User interface and a back end in order to control
- power monitoring

### Smart Grid

- Household energy management system
- solar array to house hold
- also import/buy energy externally
- minimise energy imports using an algorithm
- needs a user interface

### Mathematics accelerator

- Hybrid software/hardware system
- Visualising a mathematical "thing"
- written in system verilog
- Needs User interaction
